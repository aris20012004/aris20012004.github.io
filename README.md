# Amalthea Website
This is a *front end* <u>**proof of concept**</u> for the Amalthea LLC project. The website itself has no actual functionalities and objectives other than showcasing the "front-end" look.

In this website the user can:
* Switch between the **three** different sub-pages: Home, Race, Shop
* Make a booking by going to the "Race" sub-page, selecting a track (images not provided yet), selecting a date and submitting the form. When the button is pressed, there is a quick confirmation message displayed.
* Browse Amalthea's products by going to "Shop" sub-page. The user can scroll through the list of products, add a certain number of each one, and click the products to display extra information underneath them (baskets only).

## How to setup (non-dev)
To see and play around with the website, do the following:
1. Locate `index.html` inside the root folder.
2. Right-click it, "Open with", and select any browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.)
3. The homepage should appear in a browser window tab. You can now test the website.
